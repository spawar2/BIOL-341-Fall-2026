#Author: Pawar, Date: 08/26/2026, Purpose: Microarray analysis

# Install microarray affy package

if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("affy")

# Load the affy package

library(affy)

# Set the working directory for R

setwd("/Users/pawar/Desktop")

# Read the Affymetrix dataset in R

data <- ReadAffy()

# Plot the read dataset as a boxplot

boxplot(data)

# Preprocessing the microarray chips using Normalization

Normalizeddata <- rma(data)

# Boxplot the normalized dataset

Normalizeddata <- exprs(Normalizeddata)

boxplot(Normalizeddata)

# Assume first 2 chips are Cancer/Treatment type and the next 2 are Normal/Reference chips

Treatment <- Normalizeddata[,c(1,2)]
Control <- Normalizeddata[,c(3,4)]

# Taking averages on rows for Treatment and Control so we have 1 column for Treatment and 1 column for Control



# Fold change analysis for determining significant genes, Up-regulation and Down-regulation of genes
# Fold changes can be performed using subtraction and division

Fold_Changes <- Treatment - Control
